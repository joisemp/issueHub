# Service Management App

A comprehensive Django-based service management system designed for organizations to manage all their services efficiently. The system includes issue reporting, service tracking, and maintenance workflows with role-based access control.

## Features

- **Service Management**: Complete service lifecycle management for organizations
- **Issue Reporting**: Users can report service issues with descriptions, images (up to 3), and voice recordings
- **Role-based Access**: Support for different user types (central_admin, maintainer, regular users)
- **Status Management**: One-way issue status progression (inspected â†’ work in progress â†’ resolved/escalated)
- **Assignment System**: Central admins can assign issues to maintainers
- **Organization Support**: Multi-organization support with service categorization
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, clean interface with Bootstrap styling

## Status Workflow

The system enforces a strict one-way status progression:
1. **Not Addressed** â†’ **Inspected** (maintainer sets as inspected)
2. **Inspected** â†’ **Work In Progress** (maintainer starts work)
3. **Work In Progress** â†’ **Resolved** or **Escalated** (maintainer completes or escalates)

Once an issue is resolved or escalated, it cannot be changed.

## User Roles

- **Central Admin**: Can assign issues to maintainers and oversee all organizational services
- **Maintainer**: Can update issue status, manage assigned issues, and maintain services
- **Regular User**: Can report service issues and view service status

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **This project is currently under development** ðŸš§

The core service management and issue tracking functionality is implemented but the system is still being refined and enhanced. Additional service management features are being developed to provide a complete organizational service management solution.
